TapTapPass
==========

TapTapPass is a tweak to manage your passcode lock. Works through activator. 

It's extremely messy at the moment, as it's in the stage between releases, and it may not work well, or even at all. However, I'm actively working on cleaning up the code. A lot.

If you have any ideas, feel free to send me an email at bryce.dougherty@gmail.com

If you would like to help, please submit an issue/pull request!


Planned Features:

	•	Support for PatternUnlock, Stride, and similar
	•	Addition of a preference pane for configuration (in progress)
	•	Allow for the reversal of the lock function (activator action locks without, rather than with a passcode)
