TapTapPass
==========

TapTapPass is a tweak to manage your passcode lock. Works through activator. 

It's extremely messy at the moment, but I'm working on cleaning up the code. A lot.

If you have any ideas, feel free to send me an email at bryce.dougherty@gmail.com

If you would like to help, please submit an issue/pull request!


Planned Features:

	•	Support for PatternUnlock, Stride, and similar
	•	Addition of a preference pane for configuration (in progress)
	•	Allow for the reversal of the lock function (activator action locks without, rather than with a passcode)
